Unlock the full potential of your performance data with the `performancetotal-cli` app!

If youâ€™re using the Performance-total plugin for Playwright, Pytest, or WebdriverIO, but you want to only analyze the performance data __without__ generating new data by running tests, this tool is for you! Seamlessly analyze and visualize performance results generated by the [playwright-performance](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playwright-performance), [wdio-performancetotal-service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wdio-performancetotal-service) or by the [pytest-performancetotal](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-performancetotal/) plugins. This CLI tool provides comprehensive insights to help you optimize and enhance your application's performance.

## Installation

Install the app globally using the following command:

```
npm install -g performancetotal-cli
```

## Usage

There are two mandatory parameters for `performancetotal-cli`:

1. **Source Path**: The absolute path to the source file or directory. If a directory path is provided, all files within that directory will be used as data sources. This tool specifically uses the `performance-log.txt` (which you can rename) data files as the source data.

2. **Destination Path**: The absolute path to the destination directory where the results will be saved.

```
performancetotal-cli path/to/performance-log.txt path/to/result/directory
```

or

```
performancetotal-cli path/to/source/directory path/to/result/directory
```

## Options


### drop-failed-results

Default is `false`. When the option is used, performance analysis from failed tests would be excluded.

```
performancetotal-cli path/to/performance-log.txt path/to/result/directory/ drop-failed-results
```

### recent-days

Default is `0` (no limit). To set the number of days to consider for performance analysis, set the number of days.

```
performancetotal-cli path/to/performance-log.txt path/to/result/directory/ recent-days=3
```

Please note that partial days are also supported (e.g. `recent-days=0.5`)

### analyze-by-browser

Default is `false`. If used, the performance data would be analyzed also by the browser type.

```
performancetotal-cli path/to/performance-log.txt path/to/result/directory/ analyze-by-browser
```

## Getting the results

The results would be saved to the destination directory with 2 files: performance-results.csv and performance-results.json.
